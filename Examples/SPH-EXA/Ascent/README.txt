The source code file ascent_adaptor.h includes a pre-defined pipeline which will draw images of all particles where rho > 1.4.

We provide here basic actions files. When running an Ascent-instrumented simulation, the code will look for a file called ascent_actions.yaml in the current directory.
Copying one of these examples as file "ascent_actions.yaml" will override the pre-defined pipeline.
